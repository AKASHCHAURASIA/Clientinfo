                through
                your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your
                browser
                and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and
                process
                the
                items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous

                    behalf.

            <p>

            <h4><b>Google</b></h4>

            <p>
                Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in
                place
                to
                provide a positive experience for users.
                <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en">https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en</a>
            </p>

            <p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>

            <p>
                Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie
                enables
                it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may
                opt
                out
                of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.
            </p>

            <p>We have implemented the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remarketing with Google AdSense</li>
                <li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We along with third-party vendors, such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics
                cookies)
                and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to
                compile
                data regarding user interactions with ad impressions, and other ad service functions as they relate to
                our
                website.
            </p>

            <h4><b>Opting out:</b></h4>
            <p>
                Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page.
                Alternatively,
                you
                can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising initiative opt out page or permanently using the Google

            <h4><b>California Online Privacy Protection Act</b></h4>

            <p>
                CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post
                a
                privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
                United
                States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
                from
                California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information
                being
                collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more

                <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>
            </p>

            <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can visit our site anonymously</li>
                <li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on
                    the first
                    significant page after entering our website.
                </li>
                <li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page
                    specified above.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Users are able to change their personal information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>By emailing us</li>
                <li>By logging in to their account</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><b>How does our site handle do not track signals?</b></h4>

            <p>
                We don't honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not
                Track
                (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
            </p>

            <h4><b>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</b></h4>
            <p>It's also important to note that we allow third party behavioral tracking</p>

            <h4><b>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b></h4>

            <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online
                Privacy
                Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer
                protection
                agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do
                to
                protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>

            <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>

            <h4><b>Fair Information Practices</b></h4>

            <p>
                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
                concepts
                they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
                Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
                comply
                with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
            </p>

            <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                should
                a data breach occur:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will notify the users via email within 7 business days</li>
                <li>We will notify the users via in site notification within 7 business days</li>
            </ul>

           <p>
               We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue
               legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
               principle
               requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
               have
